_*Crew Centre HTTP 500 ERROR June20*_

```We are aware of an ongoing HTTP 500 Error when accessing the crew centre and are actively attempting to solve the issue surrounding our error system. 
If you are accessing the crew centre and are greeted with a HTTP 500 Error, it means you aren't logged in. A simple fix to this is by going to https://ifqantasvirtual.com/login and logging in.

If you log in and are still having the HTTP 500 issue, it means you are entering the wrong login information. It would appear the system for validating incorrect logins is down, so you need to either enter the right email/password, or reset your login information. 
Please contact staff if you encounter further issues.```
